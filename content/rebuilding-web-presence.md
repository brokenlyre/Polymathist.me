## Wayback and back again

<!-- PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY -->
I just took a stroll through the [wayback machine](https://web.archive.org/) to get a sense at how long I've been at this from a website perspective. As far as I can tell one of main properties was stood up around 2002 where I used a cutting edge flash animation as my main navigation feature. The next major revamp after that included an archive of various doodles and a decent set of reviews regarding the cigars that I had endured. More on that some other time.
<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY --> 

I didn't stop with the one site as I felt the need to maintain different levels of decorum on different properties. My mind was constantly bouncing around between a blog filled with personal rants on the universe, a site dedicated to pursuing enhanced levels of business acumen, a collaboration focused on classical music, and so on and so forth. Sites popped up around me with the hope that could regularly rotate through the media empire.

Alas... my focus shifted

### Twitter

Oh my. I hadn't been on twitter for some time but just a quick dose helps me to realize that it's interesting to recognize your past vices and interests but that it's important to trim the fat to meet your current needs.

### Pelican

I know that I want to create a site but I want to do it on the cheap as much as possible. A friend has been working through a Pelican static site hosted on github and I think that is going to be the best option. There are a lot of things to figure out about this.

I came across a decent article/tutorial [here](https://appliedcaffeine.org/navbaritems.html "Applied Caffeine - Pelican navbar menu items") regarding the implementation of custom menu items in the navigation bar and that lead me to initial adopting the [bootstrap3](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes/tree/master/pelican-bootstrap3 "bootstrap3 on github") theme as a starting point for the site.
