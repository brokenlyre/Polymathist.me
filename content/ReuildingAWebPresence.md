Summary: I've done many flavors of sites in been in and out of so many different social spaces... it's time to lock in

# Wayback and back again

I just took a stroll through the [wayback machine](https://web.archive.org/) to get a sense at how long I've been at this from a website perspective. As far as I can tell one of main properties was stood up around 2002 where I used a cutting edge flash animation as my main navigation feature. The next major revamp after that included an archive of various doodles and a decent set of reviews regarding the cigars that I had endured. More on that some other time.

I didn't stop with the one site as I felt the need to maintain different levels of decorum on different properties. My mind was constantly bouncing around between a blog filled with personal rants on the universe, a site dedicated to pursuing enhanced levels of business acumen, a collaboration focused on classical music, and so on and so forth. Sites popped up around me with the hope that could regularly rotate through the media empire.

I know that I want to create a site but I want to do it on the cheap as much as possible. A friend has been working through a Pelican static site hosted on github and I think that is going to be the best option. There are a lot of things to figure out about this.
