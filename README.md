# Stuart M. Davis - Polymath

So the title may be a bit boisterous, but I usually refrain from flaunting myself. I just like lots of things and tend to be able to get fairly decent in a short amount of time. So rather than manage twenty different sites, this will be the one.

Given many discussions with [a good friend](https://github.com/NapsterInBlue), I decided to take the plunge into building a static site and creating a workflow with it via python and the associated loads of libraries that will support such creation such as [pelican](http://getpelican.com)
