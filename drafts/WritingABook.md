Summary: A few thoughts about my on and off again consideration to write a book

# I'm writing a book

So I've been thinking about writing a book. It's certainly been on my mind for some time. In fact, it had probably been on others' minds more than mine prior to this point.

Perhaps that's how a lot of books start.
>Oh my. That's brilliant. You should write a book.

>Hey, could you just teach 'so and so' about how you do things. Or better yet, when are you going to write the book?

Granted I've never written a book before. And when I haven't done stuff before, I tend to engage in a bit of research looking for videos, best practices, and tools. So what did I come across?
