<!-- PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY -->
I've got too many tools that fill various gaps and I'm wondering if I can bring it all together
<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY --> 

- A decent place to take notes
- A decent place to store notes
- A way to connect notes amongst each other
- A way to connect notes to capabilities or completed artifacts
- A place to write my book
- A place to organize my research
- A place to store tasks
- A place to prioritize tasks
- A place to work on tasks

I feel like I have come across a few concepts that I would like to leverage and am trying to decide if I need to roll my own or not.

### Nirvana
Nirvana is a decent place to store tasks and prioritize them to a certain degree. This allows for parallel and sequential planning and completion.
### OmniFocus
OmniFocus is a great place for lists and contexts of the lists. It does allow for planning to a certain degree.
### The Brain
The Brain is an interesting take on note taking that allows me to interconnect my thoughts. It requires a lot of meta management to make the connections. Frankly I've mostly used it as a mind mapping tool at this point and haven't really relied upon it as a notes archive
### Static site generation
Github, markdown, pelican - seem to be a great mashup to develop a static site and Nick's method of combining that with a notes section seems really cool. Sometimes when I write I seem to think as if I was going to publish something and so the ease of markdown speaks to me here.
### Neo4j
Neo4j is an interesting platform for directed graphs. I've not leveraged it en mass for true analytics but as a different method of database schema. The noun, adjective, and verb concepts help me navigate relationships in exactly the same way that I think about them.
### Python
With Python I am sure that I will be able to create some functions that publish appropriate content in the ways that I see fit. It will allow me to roll some of these concepts together and even just the process of trying will likely teach me a lot.
