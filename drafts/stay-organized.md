<!-- PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY -->
I've dealt with organizing and re-organizing and I'm sure I'll just continue dealing with it
<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY --> 

No.

I've tried so many different ways to stay organized that it's impossible to keep them organized!

## GTD - Getting Things Done

David Allen's [Getting Things Done (GTD)] has been a constant goal post for me. It has a fairly solid place in my work environment but lacks a little bit in my personal life.

## GTD in Email

I have done quite a good job over the years of using GTD in email. You can see my post about my full integration and tell me what you think.

## Tickler Files

I have tried tickler files once in a while but I find that the issue is that there is no really great "beautiful" place to set it up so that I can interact with it **and** have it be aesthetically pleasing.

## Nirvana

[Nirvana HQ] has been a good tool for organizing tasks in the GTD principles. I've used it off and on.
